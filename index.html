        About
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Erketu Ellisoni is a long-necked dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous Period. It was named after the Mongolian
        god Tengri, the chief ruler of multiple old religions in Central Asia. Further, it was also named after one of
        its discoverer&rsquo;s friends—Mick Ellison—leading to the Ellisoni part of its name. It has been predicted that the
        dinosaur reached up to 15m long and weighed around 5 tons. The Erketu represents its own clade of dinosaurs, as
        well as its own genus.

        Lifestyle
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Erketu was a terrestrial dinosaur which mainly resided in swamp-like floodplains in northeast Asia. It is
        thought to be an herbivore like many other dinosaurs of its type. Limited discovery leaves many details about
        the Erketu to speculation. With this in mind, it has been assumed by palaeontologists that in accordance to
        other dinosaurs of its type, that it may have lived up to 100 years old.

            Floodplains were marshy, swamplike lands found next to rivers. These locations were subject to flooding, but
            were very supportive to a variety of wildlife.

            The Erketu was assumed to have eaten conifers——the dominant plant of the time.

            Due to its large size, it most likely didn&rsquo;t have any primary predators and instead was more threatened by
            changes to the environment and ecosystem, as well as natural disasters and weather.

        Behaviour
    </h2>
        <p>
            Many minute details about the Erketu remain undiscovered. Much about its lifestyle and behaviour in facts unable to be
            specified from bone content as mere speculation. In consideration to other dinosaurs of its type, it was probably a calm
            and sociable being. It is also thought to have performed mating rituals and have a reptilian birthing cycle.

        Fossil Discovery
    </h2>
        <p>
            The Erketu was originally discovered by Daniel Ksepka and Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History’s
            Mongolian Branch. Its fossils were first discovered in 2002 during a field expedition. In 2006, the dinosaur was first
            completely identified and named. The site was revisited in 2010 to recover some remains which had originally been left
            behind. The Erketu is one of the first sauropods found from the Bayan Shireh Formation of Dornogovi, Mongolia. Only one
            other specimen has been located in Shandong, China. Other relatives have been found in the Ruyang Basin of Henan
            Province and the surrounding area. Its neck was discovered to be two times bigger than the rest of its body, and was
            also noted to have an unusually short tail for the necessary assumed balance. The discovery of these fossils led to a
            breakthrough regarding prehistoric muscle functions in the necks of Titanosauriformes. While many palaeontologists had
            originally believed that these long-necked dinosaurs held their heads vertically (similar to a giraffe), the sheer size
            of the Erketu challenged the proposed facts. With some further research about better-studied relatives of the Erketu, it
            became clear that dinosaurs of this size most likely grazed with their necks parallel to the floor.
